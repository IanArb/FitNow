# FitNow

## Description
FitNow is a final year project that was developed during my time at National College of Ireland. The Android app allows you to track your fitness, compare your statistics with friends and compete with others users with a leaderboard. 

## Installation 
In order to contribute to the project you must create your own google-services.json file which can be generated via Firebase console:
https://console.firebase.google.com/

You must activate authentication and realtime database in the Firebase Console to start contributing to the app.

## Usage
The project contains three build flavours which can be modified by using the Build Variants in Android Studio IDE.

These are the following flavours available:

- Snapshot: This is considered the day-to-day development enviroment
- Staging: This is considered the pre-production enviroment which is used for testing
- Production: This is considered the production enviroment for the play store
